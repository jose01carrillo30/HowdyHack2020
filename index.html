            This past summer, Google announced that it will be shutting down the Community Contributions feature of Youtube on September 28 of this year,
            citing a lack of use and reports of "spam and abuse." The tool was primarily used to let anyone contribute translations for video titles or
            submit descriptions, closed captions, or subtitles. Google also announced that its two other captioning options - auto-generated or manual
            - will remain available, and that it is offering to cover the cost of a 6-month subscription of Amara.org for all creators who have used the
            Community Contribution feature for at least 3 videos in the last 60 days. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to continue supporting this YouTube feature as best as we can as a community. Not all content creators can
            afford to pay for captioning services and the auto-generated captions are not reliable and lose the essence of the actual video and its
            message. Not only does this affect the vieiwing experience for people who do not speak the language spoken in the video, but it also
            prevents people with disabilities from fully enjoying the video, and that's not good at all. All contributions are much appreciated and we
            thank you for your time!
